In this module we are going to learn how to upload a image, what  is texture and how to upload texture on a sprite and much more.
In this module I am not going to cover each and every functions, I cover only important functions that most of the programmers generally use.
So, if you want to know more functions then please visit to original documentation of SFMML:)
